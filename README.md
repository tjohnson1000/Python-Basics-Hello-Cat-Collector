# Python Basics: Hello & Cat Collector Scripts

## Overview
This project introduces **basic Python programming concepts** through two beginner-friendly scripts. It covers **console interaction, user input, string concatenation, and basic type conversion**—perfect for those just starting their Python journey.

## Files Included
- `hello.py`: A classic **Hello World** program that greets the user, asks for their name and age, and does a small age prediction.
- `allMyCats1.py`: A script that prompts the user to enter six cat names and prints them all in one line.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to use `print()` for console output
- Learn `input()` to capture user input
- Perform string concatenation
- Convert between strings and integers using `str()` and `int()`
- Use `len()` to find the length of a string

## Sample Output
**hello.py**
```bash
Hello world!
What is your name?
> Travis
It is good to meet you, Travis
The length of your name is:
6
What is your age?
> 33
You will be 34 in a year.
```

**allMyCats1.py**
```bash
Enter the name of cat 1: Muffin
...
Enter the name of cat 6: Smokey
The cat names are:
Muffin Shadow Tiger Luna Bella Smokey
```
